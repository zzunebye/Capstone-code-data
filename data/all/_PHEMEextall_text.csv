@gregorybouchard someone was on the CBC and they said prince is doing 2 shows from a reliable source

@680News @LiveNationON @masseyhall Lol what happened
@noggys4 I think they thought I don't know anything
@1nastyb6 will do. Faisal at Salim's on eastern (has a silver S4) is always texting me advice with repairs lol
@1nastyb6 off topic but your A4 looks good man lol
"@noggys4 Thanks , you are the guy in the beaches ? Its no 2.7tt but its frankenturbo'd"
@noggys4 Lol ya I do mine in my buildings parking lot
"@1nastyb6 damn, do you do repairs yourself now or take it somewhere else?"
"@1nastyb6  LOL yeah that's me, thought your car looked familiar. I think I'm going frankenturbo as well when my snails kick it"
@1nastyb6 yessir saving up for stage 3. I have to diagnose a fuel leak on mine. Smells like gas around the fuel rail when it's cold out
@1nastyb6 ohhhhhh shit sorry to hear. they've been alright with my car
"@noggys4 Most things ive done myself , or I take it to a guy at finch/400 if I can't complete"
"@noggys4 hate that place ,broke my abs sensor while doing my bearing and said I need a new axle ,$1300 &amp; said it was a coincidence.#scammer"
"@noggys4 check ur evap system , I had the same thing and found it was a plastic elbow in the evap system that cracked"
"@noggys4 Its well worth it , I was chipped at first til the snail went , FrankenTurbo is a huge diff in power and crazy loud spool, u stock?"
@1nastyb6 I wish I had a garage. My engine bay is so fucking tight to work. Use to do repairs on our old Volvo 850 in the driveway

@lucma66 they keep hoping for him to get ill - that's sick! But it shows a hidden truth: the West losers know they just can't win.
@pozzdan @lucma66 The west already won. Everyone else is fighting for second.

@mennodejong is he fighting on the front line ? or his girlfriend gave birth ?
@mennodejong Hope he doesn't get upset at the mocked Russian diplomacyüò±
@mennodejong LOL
Putin has obviously disappeared to binge watch the entire season 3 of House of Cards.. #putinmissing #putin
@20committee This means that Russia must pay the full price no matter who runs the show.
"@20committee And maybe with a new Dolchsto√ülegende. The Untergang was inevitable to etablish a new, democratic, Germany."
"@BartschUdo Stauffenberg Group's vision for Germany would never have been acceptable to Allies, war would have continued w/o Hitler"
"@20committee 1 to 10, how likely do you think it is that Putty-poot is getting cold?"
@BartschUdo correct: which once Allies landed in France was impossible
@20committee ok so he would have offered to continue the war on the USSR. But the aim was less conflict - the silovniki  want escalation
@20committee agree. Few expected allies to fight Red Army in east
@Benzadr1ne read more GE WW2 history
"@20committee Putin may be in Switzerland for quite the opposite of dying, see my last few tweets..."
"@20committee Stauffenbergs intention was to save Reich without Hitler , not to establish democracy"
@20committee I thought Stauffenberg's plan was to kill the fuhrer then sue for peace - Vlads replacements would like deepen the war in Ukr
"@ConsWahoo not 1 but not 10...Kremlin is behaving v oddly, no doubt: at this point literally nothing would surprise me; we'll know more soon"
"@20committee Not quite.Stauffenberg and GER nobility changed ""Op Walk√ºre"" to take control of the Wehrmacht which von Witzleben should lead"
"@20committee Are you sure about Stauffenberg, John?"
"@BartschUdo yes, he was a RW Wehrmacht officer, not a member of the Greens"
"@20committee but potentially able to make a rational peace, and save millions - good subject for some Turtledove type"
@ConsWahoo @20committee Putypoot?  Kaput.
@20committee Many Stauffenberg's supporters hoped keep inner ring of DR conquest under aristo antisem govt; hoped US/UK wd turn against SU.
@20committee Level heads that wanted to end the war earlier would have prevailed and fewer would have died in the long run..my guess
@20committee John but Tom Cruise looked so.... @BartschUdo
"@20committee Stauffenberg-Widerstand based on analysis of war situation, defeat was clear for St., feared downfall of Reich with Hitler"
"@Walt395 @20committee No. It means Germany mid- ww2 would pay the full price anyway, no matter who would run the show. Which is true."
"Stauffenberg meant well, but killing Hitler in July 1944 would have left Germany @ war, under control of Generals &amp; NSDAP types. #PutinDead"
"@GorseFires Yes, and Putin and Medvedev are a couple of leprechauns."
@GorseFires No its #Putin's coming out parade #ukraine http://t.co/L0h2yUQZtp
We've sussed it. The Kremlin's getting ready for St Patrick's Day ;) #putinmissing #putindead http://t.co/J4aOEUv4gl
@MarkusTop1 My thoughts exactly!
"@sbandera 
do we really want to make the whole planet a propaganda show?"
@sbandera @Ashtray_Cowboy  a coup is when a guy rides in on a tank
"There was no coup in #Ukraine, #Putin now admits he was the one who urged Yanukovych to flee the country. http://t.co/Zx6ZaC5osy"
@raging545 maybe he od'd
"@raging545 @edwardlucas And weapon smuggling too! Since collapse of USSR, Russia is controlled by former KGB formed gangsters."

@AndreaChalupa Yes the fact that he (if still with us) has 'allowed' these rumours to continue is...interesting.
"@AndreaChalupa ...that's the plan, confuse your opponents: Judo 101"
@AndreaChalupa he's probably deep underground finalising the targets before launch.
Putin juggling enough instability. He would make a live appearance by now to squash death/coup jitters.
