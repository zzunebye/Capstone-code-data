White smoke has been spotted above the Kremlin. It seems a new Putin has been chosen.  #putin #putindead http://t.co/LsoxhIVZA5                     
To Hell, Yankees slaves, warmongers! #putindead http://t.co/WfTRcOkOOl                                                                              
Putin has obviously disappeared to binge watch the entire season 3 of House of Cards.. #putinmissing #putin                                         
Stauffenberg meant well, but killing Hitler in July 1944 would have left Germany @ war, under control of Generals &amp; NSDAP types. #PutinDead     
We've sussed it. The Kremlin's getting ready for St Patrick's Day ;) #putinmissing #putindead http://t.co/J4aOEUv4gl                                
There was no coup in #Ukraine, #Putin now admits he was the one who urged Yanukovych to flee the country. http://t.co/Zx6ZaC5osy

Death came for Pratchett, picked up Putin for balance #putindead                                                                                    
the plot thickens - #putindead http://t.co/ViegTs8Zzq                                                                                               
Putin juggling enough instability. He would make a live appearance by now to squash death/coup jitters.
